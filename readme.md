# dotfiles

This repository contains the dotfiles I use to configure my workstations. It
contains configuration for git, vim, ssh, zsh, and macOS (which is optional).

The repository is intended to live in the `~/.dotfiles` directory. Apply the
dotfiles running `source script/bootstrap` from the project root.
